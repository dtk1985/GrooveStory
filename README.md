# GrooveStory - Music Timeline Game

A music timeline guessing game built with PHP, similar to the card game "Hitster". Players listen to songs and place them in chronological order on a timeline.

## Tech Stack

- **PHP 8.2** - Backend language
- **MariaDB** - Database
- **Apache** - Web server with mod_rewrite
- **Docker + Docker Compose** - Containerization
- **Jellyfin API** - Music metadata source

## Project Status

Work in progress - Project structure being planned.

## Quick Overview

Players guess where a song falls on a timeline by:
1. Listening to a mystery song (streamed from Jellyfin)
2. Placing it before or after another song based on release year
3. Getting points for correct placements
